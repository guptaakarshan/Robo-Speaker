# Robo-Speaker
RoboSpeaker is a Python project that converts text into speech using the pyttsx3 library. It allows users to input text, which is then spoken aloud by the system's text-to-speech engine. This project is ideal for beginners learning about Python's audio and speech synthesis capabilities.
